ProjectSync
===========

This basic console app keeps your csproj files in sync with filesystem changes, making it useful when working in a team that doesn't exclusively use Visual Studio for development.

It currently supports a single command-line parameter - the working directory to watch.

It supports a host of configuration options, all of which have "sensible" defaults, which can be seen at the top of program.cs
